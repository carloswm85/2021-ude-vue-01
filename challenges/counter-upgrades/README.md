# Counter Application Upgrades

If you look in the `challenges/counter-upgrades/` folder there is a file called `start.html`. This is what we ended up with at the end of the counter application and it will be your starting point for this exercise. You have three tasks to complete for this exercise and if you get stuck you can find the solution in the file `finish.html`.

1. Add a new button that will double the count when you click it.
2. Add a new button that will reset the count when you click it.
3. When the number is greater than 0 the count should be green.

Don't remove the negative class
Hint:Â You can add multiple class bindings by separating them with a comma.
