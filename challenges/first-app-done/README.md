# Challenge: Your First Application

In this course, you will find a series of mini-challenges. These projects are meant to help you reinforce the
concepts you just learned. In this first challenge, I want you to build a small Vue application from scratch.

1. Create a new file called `index.html` and add the boilerplate HTML to it.
2. Add the Vue script tag in the head of the HTML document
3. Create a new Vue instance that has a data property called `title`
4. The value of title should be "Up and Running with VueJS"
5. Display that title in an `h1` tag on your page.

If you get stuck there is a solution in `challenges/first-app/finish.html`.

HINT: You can visit this page to grab the script tag https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/
